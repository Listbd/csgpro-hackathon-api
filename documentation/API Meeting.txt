Security

    The API must require HTTPS
        Return an HTTP status code of 404 for all non-HTTPS requests
        Optionally redirect GET requests to use HTTPS

    The API must be secured using Basic Authentication
        Each request must include the following header
            Authorization: Basic {Username:Password}
            Authorization: Basic VGFpc2VlckpvdWRlaDpZRUFSVkZGTw==
        Basic Authentication

    The API must prevent a user from accessing another user's records
        Return a status code of 403 Forbidden

Write up API walkthrough
    Create a new user
    Create a new project
        Add role
        Add task
    Add time entry
        Explain the two approaches to recording time
    Show errors messages
    Show exception message

Known Issues
    Not all validations have been implemented
    Updating projects with roles and tasks is not currently supported
    Google Chrome (and other browsers) are caching results
